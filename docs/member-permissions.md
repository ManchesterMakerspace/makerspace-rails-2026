# MongoDB member permissions

This page is the canonical reference for named member permissions and Safety
Checkout approver assignments. The named-permission system has two similarly
shaped Mongoid collections with different roles:

| Model | MongoDB collection | Schema and role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DefaultPermission` | `default_permissions` | A global template. It has `name: String` and `enabled: Boolean` (default `false`). |
| `Permission` | `permissions` | A member-specific authorization record. It has `name: String`, `enabled: Boolean` (default `false`), and a required `member` association. |

`Member#has_many :permissions` uses `dependent: :destroy`, so destroying a
member destroys that member's permission records. Neither permission model
enforces unique names or checks names against a fixed allowlist. Both validate
only that `name` is present. Consequently, duplicate or arbitrary names can be
stored, even though arbitrary names have no effect unless application code
consumes them.

## Creation, defaults, and updates

`Member#apply_default_permissions` runs in the member's `after_create`
callback. It takes the current `DefaultPermission.list_as_hash` snapshot and
passes it to `Member#update_permissions`. For every name/value pair,
`update_permissions` updates an already associated record with the same name,
or upserts a new member-specific `Permission`.

Defaults are copied, not dynamically inherited. Changing a
`DefaultPermission` affects members created afterward but does **not** update
existing member records automatically. Likewise, a default that is `true`
does not override a member's later per-member value.

`Admin::PermissionsController#update` calls `Member#update_permissions` and
writes a `permissions_updated` audit event containing before and after
snapshots. This update path never deletes records. Other than dependent
deletion when a member is destroyed, removals require direct model/database
maintenance. Normal revocation should retain the record and set `enabled` to
`false`.

## Reading permissions and API routes

`Member#get_permissions` returns every stored permission for that member as a
name-to-Boolean hash. `Member#is_allowed?` grants access only if a matching
member record exists and its `enabled` value is truthy. A missing record and a
disabled record both deny access.

The authenticated member endpoint exposes that hash:

* `GET /members/:member_id/permissions` — handled by
  `Members::PermissionsController#index`. It permits the member themself, an
  admin, a board member, or a resource manager; other callers are forbidden.

The admin endpoints are:

* `GET /admin/permissions` — handled by
  `Admin::PermissionsController#index`. It returns the distinct names actually
  found in the per-member `permissions` collection. Names present only in
  `default_permissions` do not appear.
* `PATCH /admin/permissions/:id` (also `PUT`) — updates the member identified by
  `:id` from the `member[permissions]` hash and records the audit event.

## Recognized names and current consumers

`DefaultPermission::WHITELISTS` is the application's current registry of
recognized names:

| Name | Current code consumer |
| --- | --- |
| `billing` | `BillingGate` passes the constant to `Member#is_allowed?`; this is member-level enforcement. |
| `earned_membership` | No direct member-level enforcement path currently consumes this constant. |
| `paypal_transfer` | The member-review rake task directly queries the matching globally enabled `DefaultPermission` before sending its PayPal report. It does not call `Member#is_allowed?`. |
| `ping_no_purchase` | The member-review rake task directly queries the matching globally enabled `DefaultPermission` before sending its no-purchase report. It does not call `Member#is_allowed?`. |

`custom_billing` appears in test seed data, but is not an application-defined
permission and has no production consumer currently.

## What `enabled` means

The model containing the field determines its meaning:

* On `DefaultPermission`, `enabled` is the value copied into a newly created
  member's permission. Global feature/report logic may also query the default
  record directly, as the member-review task does.
* On `Permission`, `enabled` determines whether that particular member passes
  `Member#is_allowed?` for the name.

Setting either field to `false` retains both the record and its name; it does
not remove anything. Because defaults are only copied at member creation, a
default value of `true` never supersedes a member's later per-member value.

## Adding a new permission name

1. Choose one canonical `snake_case` name and add it to
   `DefaultPermission::WHITELISTS`.
2. Add a `DefaultPermission` record through the project's deployment, seed, or
   migration mechanism. Choose its initial `enabled` value intentionally.
3. Reference the canonical constant from the controller, service, or task that
   enforces the feature. Use `Member#is_allowed?` for member-specific
   authorization.
4. Decide whether existing members need a `Permission` backfill. Updating or
   inserting a default alone does not propagate to them.
5. If the name must appear in `Admin::PermissionsController#index`, ensure at
   least one per-member record exists, or separately revise that endpoint to
   read from a canonical registry.
6. Update factories and specs to cover default copying, enabled, disabled,
   missing-record, update, and authorization behavior.

Merely inserting an arbitrary `name` passes current model validation, but does
not make the permission functional. Some controller, service, or task must
consume that name.

## Checkout approver assignments

Safety Checkout signoff also uses member-associated `CheckoutApprover` records
in `checkout_approvers`. These scopes operate alongside the named `Permission`
records above. All assignment arrays default to empty. Group signoff still
enforces membership, group/tool availability, and the reviewed group revision.

| Field | Scope and effect |
| --- | --- |
| `shop_ids` | Whole-shop signoff authority for physical tools and groups in the assigned shops. |
| `tool_ids` | Individual physical-tool authority, additive with shop assignments. Having every child-tool assignment does not confer signoff authority for the group itself. |
| `tool_group_ids` | Explicit authority for the selected, nonarchived groups. `CheckoutApprover#can_approve_group?` accepts either the group's shop assignment or its explicit group assignment. |
| `group_granted_tool_ids` | Internal ledger of physical-tool grants materialized from group assignments. Validation unions these IDs into `tool_ids`; administrative assignment parameters do not accept this ledger. |

`CheckoutApprover#expand_group_authority` expands an assigned group's current
included tools into both the ledger and `tool_ids`. `ToolGroupCatalog.save!`
propagates newly included tools to existing group approvers under the catalog and
approver locks. This changes signoff authority without creating Safety Checkouts
or volunteer credit for the assignee. Removed child tools retain their materialized
grants. Removing a group assignment or archiving its group retains these individual
grants as well, including when an update supplies an empty `tool_ids` array.
Archival removes the explicit group assignment.

Revoking an individual checkout calls `CheckoutApproverVolunteering.revoke_for!`:
it removes that child from `tool_ids` and `group_granted_tool_ids` and removes
assignments to groups that contain the revoked tool. Direct assignment or
reassignment to such a group fails validation while the revoked checkout exists.
Catalog edits that add a revoked child remove the affected explicit group assignment
instead of extending its grants.
Deleting the approver record removes all of its persisted signoff scopes. Group
signoff assignments do not grant catalog management; catalog writes require
Admin/Board or the shop's assigned resource manager.

| Mutation path | Authorization and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Admin::CheckoutApproversController#create/update/destroy` | Admin/Board manage scopes through `POST /api/admin/checkout_approvers` and `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/admin/checkout_approvers/:id`. Create merges shop/tool/group assignments; update replaces supplied scopes while validation retains materialized child grants; delete removes the record. Changes are audited. |
| `ToolGroupVolunteering#create!/decide!` | The member must be current and hold active checkouts for every included tool to volunteer. Approval rechecks eligibility and adds the group ID to the approver record. The decision actor must pass `CheckoutApproverVolunteering.reviewer?`: Admin, Board, or RM role with the group shop in `resource_manager_shop_ids`. |
| `ToolGroupCatalog.save!` | Group membership edits extend persistent child grants; archival removes explicit group IDs. The actor must be Admin/Board or the group's shop RM. |
| `ToolCheckout` revocation callbacks | Call `CheckoutApproverVolunteering.revoke_for!` to remove the revoked child and affected group assignments, coordinating through the member's approver lock. |

Current consumers include:

- `ToolGroupCheckout.authorized?`, used by the group API, `ToolGroupSerializer`'s
  `can_approve`, Slack approval modals and workflows, and
  `CheckoutInteractionQuery#visible_group_requests`, enforces group
  signoff through administrative/shop-management authority or an eligible member's
  `CheckoutApprover#can_approve_group?` scope.
- `ToolGroupVolunteering.create!`, `CheckoutInteractionQuery#volunteerable_groups`,
  and the Slack workflow use `can_approve_group?` to exclude already assigned
  volunteers.
- `CheckoutApprover#can_approve_tool?`, `CheckoutCreation.authorized?`, and
  `CheckoutInteractionQuery#approvable_tools` consume the materialized `tool_ids`
  through the existing physical-tool signoff paths.
- `CheckoutApproverSerializer` exposes explicit group IDs and group summaries;
  `CheckoutReadContext.for_approvers` batches their catalog details for approver
  management responses.

This assignment path needs no `DefaultPermission` name or copied-default backfill.

## Rails console examples

Inspect the global templates and a member's stored permissions:

```ruby
DefaultPermission.order_by(name: :asc).pluck(:name, :enabled)

member = Member.find("MEMBER_ID")
member.get_permissions
member.permissions.order_by(name: :asc).pluck(:name, :enabled)
```

Enable or revoke access through the normal update path (revocation disables
the record rather than deleting it):

```ruby
member.update_permissions(billing: true)
member.reload.is_allowed?(DefaultPermission::WHITELISTS[:billing]) # => truthy

member.update_permissions(billing: false)
member.reload.is_allowed?(DefaultPermission::WHITELISTS[:billing]) # => falsey
```

Inspect the distinct names stored on members (the source used by the admin
index):

```ruby
Permission.distinct(:name)
# Equivalent application helper:
Permission.list_permissions
```
