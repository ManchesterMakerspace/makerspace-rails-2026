# Makerspace Rails agent handbook

## 1. Repository purpose and boundaries

Rails manages members, access cards, billing, rentals, workshops, reservations,
volunteering, repair tickets, and integrations. It serves the API, public resources,
and the shell/assets for the separately built React portal.
Use Ruby 3.4 and Bundler from `Gemfile.lock`; start with `bundle install`.
Use disposable test databases. Preserve server authorization, authentication/TOTP/
CSRF, and the documentation obligations in section 4.

This and `makerspace-react-2026` are independent Git checkouts. Inspect
`git status --short`, preserve existing changes, and set an explicit working
directory for each command. Backend-only work does not require a sibling checkout;
RSpec can use the UI stubs described in section 5.
This is the canonical handbook; keep overlapping companion instructions aligned.

| Tool | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | Root `AGENTS.md` via [native discovery](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md). Sessions launched from the enclosing workspace must explicitly read the applicable repository handbook before working there. |
| Claude Code | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) imports this file with unquoted `@AGENTS.md`, including for sessions without native AGENTS loading; no symlink is needed. See [memory imports](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory). |
| Cursor | Read root `AGENTS.md` directly using [Cursor rules](https://cursor.com/docs/rules); no additional Cursor rules file. |
| GitHub Copilot | [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) summarizes critical rules and directs readers here. Its link is not an automatic import; [support varies by surface](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-instructions-support). |

## 2. Setup and common commands

Current stack: Ruby 3.4, Rails 8, Mongoid/MongoDB, Redis, and Sprockets serving
compiled React assets. [Gemfile](Gemfile), [Gemfile.lock](Gemfile.lock), and
[GitHub Actions CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) are command/version references.
The lockfile records Ruby 3.4.5 and Bundler 4.0.18. From this repository root:

```sh
gem install bundler -v 4.0.18
bundle install
```

Recheck `BUNDLED WITH` when the lockfile changes. Keep dependency changes scoped.
MongoDB/Redis must be reachable and application environment values configured before
boot. Start with [sample.env](sample.env), then [environment-vars.MD](docs/environment-vars.MD)
and CI's per-job environment blocks. CI dummy credentials support mocked tests;
they are not working integration secrets.

### Environment selection

[config/application.rb](config/application.rb) explicitly loads `production.env`
for `RAILS_ENV=production`, `development.env` for `RAILS_ENV=development` unless
`TEST_MAIL` is present, and `test.env` otherwise (including development mail preview).
`dotenv-rails` is also installed; `.env` alone is not the complete loading story.
Set `RAILS_ENV` in the launching shell before boot and inspect effective settings
without logging secrets. Ignored environment files stay local.

PowerShell, after configuring development services and environment values:

```powershell
$env:RAILS_ENV = 'development'
bundle exec rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 3002
```

Bash equivalent:

```sh
export RAILS_ENV=development
bundle exec rails s -b 127.0.0.1 -p 3002
```

Port 3002 matches React's fixed development proxy; `bundle exec rails s` normally
uses 3000. For Rails-served E2E use test configuration and port 3035 instead.

| Command | Use / prerequisite |
| --- | --- |
| `bundle exec rspec <spec-path>` | Focused RSpec; replace the placeholder with an actual path under `spec/`. |
| `bundle exec parallel_rspec spec/ -n 4` | Full suite with four isolated worker databases; see section 5. |
| `bundle exec ruby scripts/ci/verify-mongo-transactions.rb` | Real commit/rollback probe against a disposable test database. |
| `bundle exec rake rswag:specs:swaggerize` | Regenerate API artifact after updating/running affected executable API specs. |
| `bundle exec rails assets:precompile` | Asset check with production configuration and complete built UI; mirror CI's `compile-production` environment. |
| `git diff --check` | Whitespace validation, including documentation-only work. |

There is no root Compose quick start. The [devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
uses [.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml](.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml), Docker,
Compose, a root `.env`, and a populated `ui/` checkout expected by its Dockerfile.
It does not provision every secret or verify transaction readiness. See the
qualified [README setup](README.md#development-container); configuration repairs
are separate from documenting what currently exists.

## 3. Architecture and implementation conventions

### Current layout

| Area | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Routing and requests | [config/routes.rb](config/routes.rb), [app/controllers](app/controllers), controller concerns, [ApplicationController](app/controllers/application_controller.rb). |
| Persistence | [app/models](app/models), [config/mongoid.yml](config/mongoid.yml), model fields/relations/indexes and [collection inventory](docs/mongodb-collections.MD). |
| Output contracts | [app/serializers](app/serializers); presenters such as [fix_ticket_presenter.rb](app/services/fix_ticket_presenter.rb) live in `app/services`. Some controllers render hashes directly. |
| Policies/business operations | [app/services](app/services), including `reservation_policy.rb`, `fix_ticket_policy.rb`, and `card_management.rb`; access helpers also live in controllers/models. |
| Background work | [app/jobs](app/jobs), [app/mailers](app/mailers), templates in `app/views`, [lib/tasks](lib/tasks), and [config/schedule.rb](config/schedule.rb). |
| Integration helpers | [app/helpers](app/helpers), [lib/service](lib/service), and `app/services/service` for payments, Slack, Google, access, and related operations. |
| Tests/API spec | [spec](spec), shared fixtures/helpers in [spec/support](spec/support), executable contracts in [spec/api](spec/api). |
| UI integration | `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`, `app/assets/config/manifest.js`, `app/assets/builds/`, and [asset configuration](config/initializers/assets.rb). |

Mongoid is the persistence layer. ActiveRecord is disabled; do not assume SQL
migrations, schema files, transactional fixtures, or SQL-backed factories.
Inspect embedded/top-level documents, collection overrides, indexes, and callbacks.
Use operational tasks for index work only when their data effects are part of the
task; a spec is not a production rollout.

### Practices for changes

- Follow local Ruby style/service boundaries. Keep controllers focused on request,
  authorization, and response behavior; reuse domain policies/services.
- Enforce permissions on the server per resource. Preserve shop/tool scope,
  admin/board distinctions, membership eligibility, and public/member visibility.
  React hiding an action or a caller supplying an ID does not authorize a request.
- Preserve Devise cookies, TOTP challenge/enrollment gates, CSRF, and provider auth.
  Test unauthenticated, ordinary-member, privileged, and out-of-scope requests
  when changing access.
- [JSON key transformation](config/initializers/json_param_key_transformer.rb)
  underscores JSON input (preserving `cf-turnstile-response`) and configures
  ActiveModelSerializers with `camel_lower`. Direct hashes/presenters can differ.
  Preserve endpoint-specific envelopes, casing, status/errors, pagination headers,
  and public representations; inspect actual request specs.
- Public `/api/config` values must remain safe to expose. Keep secrets server-side
  and preserve React/native session and configuration contracts.
- Preserve atomic card/ticket operations and failure semantics. Do not replace
  required MongoDB transactions with an unsafe standalone-database fallback.
- Rails 8 gems coexist with older framework defaults in `config/application.rb`.
  Document discrepancies and scope upgrades separately; do not silently change
  application behavior to match generic Rails conventions.

## 4. Task-specific documentation

### Authoritative documentation-maintenance table

Documentation updates are part of implementation, including those required by an
already-authorized task. Apply every relevant row when behavior changes.
This consolidates the obligations formerly repeated in the documentation agent;
[agents/docs-agent.md](agents/docs-agent.md) refers here.

| Change | Required documentation |
| --- | --- |
| Email behavior | Update [email.MD](docs/email.MD) whenever sending code changes: triggers, recipients, subjects, template selection, and fallbacks. |
| Environment variables | Update [environment-vars.MD](docs/environment-vars.MD) for additions, removals, renames, requirements, defaults, and fallbacks in application, configuration, executables, or tasks. |
| Collections or indexes | Update [mongodb-collections.MD](docs/mongodb-collections.MD) for names/overrides, additions/removals/renames/repurposing, lifecycle and index changes; distinguish embedded documents from top-level collections. |
| Public resources | Update [public-resources.MD](docs/public-resources.MD) and linked feature documentation for public/deep-linkable API or rendered routes: additions/removals/renames, methods, authentication, formats, and parameters. |
| Jobs, tasks, or supporting services | Update [jobs-tasks-services.MD](docs/jobs-tasks-services.MD) for additions, removals, renames, rescheduling, and other job/task/service changes: admin job inventory, recurring production work, invocation, purpose, side effects, status tracking, and failure behavior. Cover every job returned by `GET /api/admin/system_configs` or accepted by `POST /api/admin/system_configs/run_job`, all `config/schedule.rb` work, other tasks identified in source as recurring in production, and manual production commands. |
| Member statuses or permissions | Update [member-statuses.md](docs/member-statuses.md) and/or [member-permissions.md](docs/member-permissions.md) for additions/removals/renames, semantics, and consumers. Maintain the status mutation-path appendix for endpoints, webhooks, callbacks, jobs, tasks, and every path that starts/stops changing an existing member's status. |
| API contracts | Update executable [spec/api](spec/api) specifications for endpoint additions/changes/removals, including routes, authentication/authorization, parameters, request/response bodies, and status codes. Run affected examples, regenerate with `bundle exec rake rswag:specs:swaggerize`, and include [swagger/v1/swagger.json](swagger/v1/swagger.json) in the change. |

Read feature references by task, not as a mandatory full-document sweep:

| Task | References |
| --- | --- |
| Cards/NFC or assignment | [Card assignment](docs/card-assignment.md), [MongoDB tests](docs/testing-mongodb.md), member permissions/statuses above. |
| Checkouts, tools, shops | [Checkout](docs/checkout.MD), [tool groups](docs/tool-groups-validation.MD), [public catalog](docs/public-catalog.md). |
| Reservations/query performance | [Reservations](docs/reservations.MD), [performance](docs/reservation-performance.MD). |
| Repairs/bounties | [Fix tickets](docs/fix-tickets.MD), [volunteer public resources](docs/volunteer-public-resources.MD). |
| Rental links/shortcodes | [Rental spots](docs/rental-spots.MD), [shortcodes](docs/shortcodes.md), [resolution](docs/shortcode-resolution.MD). |

Keep filename casing (`.MD` versus `.md`) exact for Linux. Update this handbook and
Copilot summary together when guidance changes. In completion/PR notes, identify
inventories updated or explain why none applied, and explicitly state whether
the environment-variable inventory changed.

## 5. Testing and completion criteria

Start with `bundle exec rspec <spec-path>` for affected behavior. Expand to related
request/API/service/job examples for shared behavior, authorization, and contracts;
use `bundle exec parallel_rspec spec/ -n 4` for broad changes, dependencies, or
framework/build changes. Asset changes also need the compile check in section 2.
Application suites are unnecessary for a documentation-only edit.

### Test environment and assets

Use the `rspec` CI job's fixtures with Redis and disposable MongoDB data.
[rails_helper.rb](spec/rails_helper.rb) forces test mode; DatabaseCleaner uses
deletion before/after examples, not SQL fixture rollback. Parallel workers use
`TEST_ENV_NUMBER` for separate databases (`makerspace_test`, `makerspace_test2`,
`makerspace_test3`, `makerspace_test4`) through
[TestDatabaseUri](lib/service/test_database_uri.rb), preserving URI options.
Set an explicit test database name in `MLAB_URI`; never point tests at valued data.
Separate runs must not share worker databases. Redis is also required; database
isolation does not imply external-service or Redis isolation.

View-rendering specs need UI assets. For backend-only work without compiled UI,
create CI's two **empty stubs**, preserving existing real assets. PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path app/assets/builds | Out-Null
foreach ($assetName in @('makerspace-react.js', 'makerspace-react.css')) {
  $assetPath = Join-Path 'app/assets/builds' $assetName
  if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $assetPath)) { New-Item -ItemType File -Path $assetPath | Out-Null }
}
```

Bash:

```sh
mkdir -p app/assets/builds
touch app/assets/builds/makerspace-react.js app/assets/builds/makerspace-react.css
```

Stubs are for RSpec only. E2E/production compilation need complete React assets,
including async chunks and nested assets. Stub rendering does not validate the UI.
Check for stale generated manifests/assets if Sprockets fails; keep generated files
out of unrelated changes.

### Transaction coverage

Read [testing-mongodb.md](docs/testing-mongodb.md). CI uses MongoDB 7.0 as a replica
set and Redis 7. In Docker-enabled Bash, `bash scripts/ci/start-mongo.sh` creates
disposable `makerspace-ci-mongo` on port 27017 and initializes `rs0`.
It needs GNU `timeout`; use a consistent WSL/Linux environment on Windows or
provision a replica set separately. It refuses to replace an existing container.

PowerShell settings for an already running local replica set:

```powershell
$env:RAILS_ENV = 'test'
$env:MLAB_URI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/makerspace_test?replicaSet=rs0'
$env:REDIS_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
$env:REQUIRE_MONGO_TRANSACTIONS = 'true'
bundle exec ruby scripts/ci/verify-mongo-transactions.rb
```

Bash equivalent:

```sh
export RAILS_ENV=test
export MLAB_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/makerspace_test?replicaSet=rs0'
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
export REQUIRE_MONGO_TRANSACTIONS=true
bundle exec ruby scripts/ci/verify-mongo-transactions.rb
```

The probe needs the bundle/exported URI, writes/cleans a temporary document, and
verifies commit/rollback independently of RSpec. Other application settings from
CI/the inventory are still needed for RSpec and Rails boot.
Tag actual transaction-dependent examples with `requires_transactions: true`,
including requests reaching those operations. Leave lookup, authorization,
pre-transaction validation, and mocked transaction-unavailable regressions untagged;
use `requires_transactions: false` to override inherited metadata when appropriate.
Do not mock successful transactions in integration coverage.

Without exact `REQUIRE_MONGO_TRANSACTIONS=true`, tagged examples can be pending on
standalone MongoDB. Strict mode fails suite startup for unsupported topology.
Connection/authentication failures and transaction errors are real failures.
**Pending transaction examples are not exercised coverage.** Report them explicitly.

Finish with changes, checks actually run, failures/unavailable prerequisites,
pending coverage, documentation updates (including environment inventory status),
and companion-repository/release requirements. Documentation-only work needs command,
link/casing, obligation, and companion checks plus `git diff --check`.

## 6. Cross-repository changes

Inspect both checkouts/handbooks for features crossing the boundary. Trace Rails
routes/controllers/policies/serializers/specs through React wrappers, types,
capabilities, and screens. Shared auth needs password/TOTP/session/CSRF tests on
both sides; public resources also need visibility/format tests.
For endpoint changes, follow the API row in section 4 and check UI consumers.
Swagger generation does not publish `makerspace-ts-api-client`:
[lib/tasks/publish.rake](lib/tasks/publish.rake) describes a separate release workflow.
Record required client publication/dependency upgrades and deployment order.

Build React with Node 22/Yarn Classic and `yarn build`, then transfer the complete
`dist/` tree into `app/assets/builds/`. The [React handbook](../makerspace-react-2026/AGENTS.md#6-cross-repository-changes)
provides PowerShell/Bash examples; standalone checkouts can consult the
[React repository](https://github.com/ManchesterMakerspace/makerspace-react-2026).

Current GitHub Actions builds React, runs Jest/RSpec, compiles production assets,
and runs root-config Playwright in the UI checkout. E2E uses Rails on 3035,
`APP_URL=http://localhost:3035`, absolute `RAILS_DIR`, real Braintree sandbox
credentials, disposable seeded data, Redis, and a verified MongoDB replica set.
React global setup runs `bundle exec rake db:db_reset`; `RAILS_CONTAINER` uses its
container's environment without forcing test mode. Follow React's prerequisites
before running `npx playwright test` there.

## 7. Operational constraints and common pitfalls

Tests/builds differ from resets, production jobs, backfills, restores, and publishing.
Read a task's implementation and operational inventory before invoking it.
`db:db_reset` deletes/reseeds data and can interact with Braintree sandbox fixtures;
guards do not replace selecting disposable databases and credentials.
Use appropriate mocks/sandbox services for Slack, mail, Google, billing, and access.
Do not run production jobs or release tasks as routine validation.

The older [integration task](lib/tasks/integration.rake) fetches a pinned React
commit (`REACT_COMMIT` accepts a full SHA override), copies selected assets,
resets/seeds data, starts Rails, and invokes `yarn e2e`. Current React has no such
script. This differs from GitHub Actions Playwright; do not use it as the default
local E2E recipe. [CircleCI](.circleci/config.yml) and [Travis](.travis.yml) remain
historical/alternate definitions with publishing steps; their presence does not
establish that external CI services or automatic publication are active.
Keep unrelated workflow/configuration repairs out of documentation changes.

For an index change, inspect Mongoid definitions and relevant task/model specs,
update the collection inventory, and describe any separately required data rollout.
For a job change, test job/service and failure/idempotency behavior, then apply the
jobs row plus email/environment/status rows as relevant. Neither task requires
a React checkout unless its API or UI behavior changes.
