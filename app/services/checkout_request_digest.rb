# A Slack DM roll-up for each approver listing every open checkout request they
# can act on (requests they could not approve, such as one from an expired member,
# are left out), oldest requester first: who asked, for which tool, and how many days
# it has waited. To keep the volume low, a recipient is messaged at most once a
# day, and only when
#
#   * there is a request they can act on that is new since their last digest, or
#   * some open request they can act on is exactly 5, 10, 15, ... days old.
#
# The digest always lists all of their open requests, not just the new or old
# ones. Days are calendar days in the application time zone.
#
# Recipients are the resource managers for the request's shop and the approvers
# assigned to the tool, its shop, or the requested group. Admin and board members
# are not included unless they also hold one of those roles, and the requester is
# never a recipient of their own request. Someone with no open requests gets no
# message. Recipients without a linked Slack account, or whose direct
# notifications are suppressed (`revoked` or `suspended`), are skipped.
#
# When a new digest is sent, the recipient's previous digest is edited into a short
# "replaced" stub (chat.update), so their history keeps one live list instead of a
# pile of out-of-date ones. The new message is always a fresh post so that it
# notifies; Slack does not alert on edits. A failed edit never blocks or repeats
# the new digest.
#
# A per-recipient, per-day Redis key stops a rerun of the job from sending the
# same digest twice; a failed send releases the key so the next run retries it.
